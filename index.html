                                <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and
                                    others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal
                                    coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread
                                    between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes
                                    COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory
                                    Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals

                                <p>The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.</p>

                                    COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to
                                    always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety.

                                    eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
                                <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there
                                    is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped

                                    COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to
                                    always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety.
                                    Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or
                                    going to the bathroom.</p>
                                <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object
                                    that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their
                                    eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
                                <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there
                                    is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped
                                    over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.</p>
